  description:
    "My journey began in community-driven college roles, where I learned how user needs, participation, and trust directly shape outcomes. Working closely with diverse groups sparked my interest in how thoughtful decisions influence engagement and long-term value. \n To explore this further, I pursued formal learning in product management and applied it through a full-semester internship. This experience exposed me to real product workflows — iteration, feedback loops, prioritization, and execution — and clarified my interest in building at the intersection of people and technology. \n Working on real-time projects strengthened my technical foundation and gave me insight into system design, architecture, and cross-functional collaboration. I learned how early technical and product decisions directly impact usability, scalability, and product quality.",
