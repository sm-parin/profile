    "In a rapidly evolving digital environment, my professional aspiration is to work on digital products where I can combine user understanding, technical clarity, and thoughtful decision-making to build meaningful solutions. \n My journey began when collegiate clubs introduced me to community-building and management. These communities were inherently user-centric, and working closely with diverse individuals helped me understand how people’s needs, participation, and trust shape outcomes. This exposure sparked my curiosity about how products are influenced by users and how thoughtful decisions shape engagement. To explore this further, I chose a product management elective that connected user understanding with systematic decision-making. This learning translated into a full-semester internship, where I experienced product management in practice and observed how ideas evolve through iteration, feedback, and execution. I realised I am most engaged when working at the intersection of people, technology, and purposeful problem-solving. \n My professional experience further reinforced this direction. Working on real-time projects exposed me to technical architecture, system design, and cross-functional collaboration. I gained clarity on how technical understanding strengthens product decisions and how early choices influence usability and scalability. ",
