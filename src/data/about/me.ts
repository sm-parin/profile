    "I’m a Frontend Developer who enjoys working at the intersection of products, people, and technology. \n I like seeing things end to end — from understanding the problem and the people it affects, to shaping interfaces that are precise, reliable, and intentional. My background across frontend development, product exposure, and community-driven roles has shaped how I think about ownership, trade-offs, and long-term impact. \n I care deeply about details, not for perfection’s sake, but because small decisions often define how a product feels and whether it earns trust. I’m most engaged when I’m close to the product, learning continuously, and building things as if they were my own.",
