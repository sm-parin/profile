    "I’m open to frontend and product-oriented opportunities where I can contribute through thoughtful execution and strong user focus. If you think there’s a potential fit, feel free to reach out. \n I’m interested in conversations where product thinking, frontend execution, and user understanding come together. \n If you’re building something thoughtful — or looking for someone who cares about both how things work and why they’re built — I’d be happy to connect. \n Say hello and let’s take it from there.",
