    "My interests are closely tied to how I grow, think, and unwind. I am genuinely invested in learning new coding skills and exploring design are interests that I find deeply fulfilling. Coding allows me to bring ideas to life and gives me a sense of control over how concepts translate into real outcomes. Design, on the other hand, has helped me appreciate the balance between aesthetics and functionality, especially from a user’s perspective. Together, they serve as a creative outlet and keep me engaged, even when I’m experimenting with something completely new. \n I am also deeply interested in reading the Mahabharata. I am fond of the fact that the epic rarely offers clear right or wrong answers, and that ambiguity often makes me pause and reflect on intent, responsibility, and consequences. \n In my free time, I enjoy playing chess, Sudoku, and card-based strategy games. I get a deep sense of satisfaction when I work through a difficult position or finally arrive at a solution. They also offer moments of calm and focus, helping me slow down and reset my mind amidst a busy schedule. \n I love playing cards. There’s something incredibly admirable about a simple deck of cards and how much fun it can create - be it the incredible games, or sleight of hand tricks, or how easily it gets incorporated into chapters like Permutations & Combinations and Probability. \n Lastly, my fondness for the Pokémon franchise goes beyond nostalgia. From collecting cards and completing video games to watching streams and competing in tournaments, it is something I genuinely enjoy",
